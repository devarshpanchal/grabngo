car pooling app on kotlin

#### This website is mainly built with the use of Kotlin. Here we have developed a website for carpooling services under the mentorship of Prof. Rupal Ravaiya, with the team of four members. Here if the person(rider) is traveling from one place to another then he can mention his details in this app and through which if pooler is interested in going So he can send the request. After installing the app, the user must have to register or sign in. After that they have to select the route from and to where they have to go. The driver and rider both have to set the route. When driver wants the particular rider, they select them and can even chat about any route specifications with rider. Both can cancel the ride before 10 minutes. Here rider's work history, rider's feedback page, pooler's history, etc things are also displayed. This project gave me the better understanding about the role of team management, how to contribute to team. I also gain the basic knowledge of Android Programming. Other than that, I realized that my problem solving ability improved towards new technological problem.
